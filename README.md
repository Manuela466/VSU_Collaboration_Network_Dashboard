## Project Objective
- **Goal**: Develop a dynamic dashboard to analyze and visualize research collaborations among VSU faculty.
- **Purpose**: Enable faculty and administrators to uncover key patterns and trends in collaborative networks.

---

## Background
- **What is Network Analysis?**
  - Studies complex networks of interconnected entities.
  - **Nodes**: Represent faculty members.
  - **Edges**: Represent collaborations between faculty members.
  - **Centrality**: Measures node importance (e.g., degree, closeness).
  - **Community Detection**: Identifies clusters or groups of closely connected nodes.

- **Why Network Analysis?**
  - Visualize and understand the structure of research collaborations.
  - Uncover key patterns and insights within the collaborative network.

---

## Data Sources
The dataset includes the following information:
- **Request Amount**: Funding or resource amount requested.
- **Submission Date**: Date of submission.
- **Collaboration Type**: Nature of the collaboration (e.g., interdepartmental).
- **Team**: Team involved in the collaboration.
- **Faculty Members**: Names of participating faculty members.
- **Department**: Department affiliations.
- **Project Title**: Title of the collaborative project.

---

## Data Analysis
### Tools Used:
- **R and RStudio**: For data manipulation, visualization, and dashboard development.
- **Shiny**: For building an interactive web application.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `readr`.
- **Visualization**: Using `ggplot2`, `visNetwork`, and `igraph`.

### Techniques:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Import, clean, and prepare data for analysis.
2. **Network Analysis**:
   - Visualize collaborations using tools like `igraph`.
3. **Dashboard Design**:
   - **UI**: Designed using `fluidPage` and `sidebarLayout`.
   - **Server Logic**: Implemented with reactive expressions and rendering outputs.

---

## Key Insights
 -Most collaborations occur within the same department. This suggests strong internal networks within departments.

### Interpretation and implications:
**Interpretation:**
- The dashboard provides a clear and intuitive visual representation of how faculty members collaborate, making it easier to identify trends and key members in the network graph.
- The dashboard also gives the viewer information about each nodes such as degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, college, and department

  **Implications:**
  - Faculty members can use the insights from the dashboard to make informed decisions about funding opportunities and strategic initiatives to promote further collaboration.

## Challenges and Future Directions
### Challenges:
- **Data Limitations**:
  - Existing records may be incomplete or outdated.
  - Informal collaborations might not be captured.

### Future Directions:
- Enhance the dashboardâ€™s user interface for better accessibility.
- Conduct longitudinal studies to track changes in collaboration patterns over time.
